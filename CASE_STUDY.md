# 📊 SmartExpense – AI Budget Predictor  
## 📌 Case Study

---

## ⭐ 1. Problem

Managing daily and monthly expenses is difficult for most users because:

- Bank SMS logs are unorganized  
- Manual expense tracking is time-consuming  
- There is no visual insight into where money goes  
- Users cannot predict overspending early  
- Budget tracking apps are often paid or complicated  

Users needed a **smart, clean, and automated** web tool to analyze spending and predict overspending risks.

---

## ⭐ 2. Solution

I developed **SmartExpense**, an AI-assisted budget prediction web application that enables users to:

- 📤 Upload bank SMS logs or expense files  
- 🧠 Automatically categorize expenses  
- 📊 Visualize their spending trends  
- 🔮 Predict overspending using statistical models  
- 🖥️ Use a modern, glassmorphic UI with animations  

SmartExpense works smoothly on both desktop and mobile with real-time charts and interactive dashboards.

## ⭐ 3. Outcome

✔ Accurate parsing of `.txt`, `.csv`, `.json` files  
✔ Auto-detection of expense categories  
✔ Trend visualizations using **Recharts**  
✔ Clean glassmorphism interface with animations  
✔ Early prediction of overspending  
✔ Fully responsive modern UI  
✔ Live deployment for public use  

This project highlights:

- Data extraction & preprocessing  
- Frontend architecture & chart rendering  
- Financial insight generation  
- Predictive analytics logic  
- Aesthetic UI design (glassmorphism + neon)

## ⭐ 4. Tech Stack

### 🚀 Frontend
- React (Vite)  
- TailwindCSS  
- Recharts  
- Framer Motion  
- React Router  

### ⚙ Backend (Future Enhancement)
- Python + FastAPI  
- Forecasting Models (Prophet / Linear Regression)  

### 🛠 Tools
- GitHub  
- Vercel (Hosting)  
- npm  

---

## ⭐ 5. Techniques Used

The app uses:

- String pattern extraction for SMS parsing  
- Category detection using rule-based + pattern matching  
- Time-series grouping for charts  
- Risk estimation based on spending velocity  
- React state management for real-time UI updates  
- Framer Motion animations

## ⭐ 6. App Flow (How It Works)

**Upload File → Parse Data → Categorize → Visualize Trends → Predict Overspending**

🔹 User uploads `.txt`, `.csv`, or `.json` files  
🔹 App extracts date, amount, and category  
🔹 Categorized expenses are displayed  
🔹 Charts visualize daily, monthly, and category-wise trends  
🔹 Prediction engine estimates overspending risk
